# Circuit simulator

Circuit simulator simulator.py is written in python. 

It is simple simulator for calculating voltages in series circuit.
You can put voltage values for one or more DC sources and resistance for optional number of resistors. Simulator.py will calculate voltages on each resistor or voltage just on one of them.
